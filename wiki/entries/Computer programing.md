#Computer programming 
Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing/building an executable computer program. 
Programming involves tasks such as:
*analysis, 
*generating algorithms, 
*profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, 
*and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding)
